# CIEL dictionary
This repo serves as a way to track issues related to use of CIEL dictionary for people working on informatics projects beyond OpenMRS. Please create an issue for a question or problem that you are experiencing 

##About 
### BACKGROUND

The Millennium Villages Project (MVP), based at the Earth Institute at Columbia University, is a new bottom-up approach to lift developing country villages out of the poverty trap that afflicts more than a billion people worldwide, and help them get on the path of self-sustaining development. Millennium Villages were in 10 countries throughout Africa (there were 12 millennium village sites in 10 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa). 

To achieve this goal, the MVP requires an information and communication system which can provide both necessary infrastructure for monitoring and evaluation, and tools for communicating among villages, cities and countries at and between several clinical and administrative levels. This system is called the Millennium Villages Global-Network (MVG-Net). It will take advantage of the latest in open source software (OpenMRS), databases (MySQL), interface terminology, centralized concept dictionary, and use appropriate technology locally for data entry.

The centralized concept dictionary requires a website for the management and collaborative generation of the fundamental elements required by the system's multi-lingual, multi-layered functionality. The site will present the terms and other data elements, descriptions, definitions and concepts used or destined for the system and will provide the medium for participation by the project's partners on terminological choices and relationships, translation, normalization and other inter-community semantic concerns.

### DATABASE VERSION
The Columbia International eHealth Lab (CIEL) concept dictionary is based upon the OpenMRS concept architecture as implemented by the Millennium Villages Project among others. The structure of the dictionary is intimately tied to the OpenMRS system and therefore follows the OpenMRS data model. The current format of the CIEL tables corresponds to the 1.11.x version of the database. The MVP/CIEL dictionary comes as standard with the new standalone version of OpenMRS (version 1.9+). It also interoperates with the 2.x platform which fundamentally leverages the 1.10 database. Additional versions are available in the dropbox.
 
### MAPPING ASSISTANCE
The mapping from the concepts to SNOMED CT, ICD-10-WHO and others is provided by a gracious donation of assistance from Intelligent Medical Objects, Inc. (http://www.e-imo.com). If you need comprehensive concepts, more interface terminology, or maps to ICD-9-CM, ICD-10-CA or ICD-10-CM you can contact IMO for licensing information.
